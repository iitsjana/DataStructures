# DataStructures

<h2>SortingStack</h2>

### General info

  * We're using STL stacks to implement an application that sorts a stack.
  * We start filling 20 elements into the stack.
  * Then, using an array, we sort the elements within the stack using merge sort.
  * Lastly, we place the sorted items into the stack again (so the stack becomes sorted) and we print the stack's content.

<h2>VideoGame</h2>

### General info

* Video Game Implementation (Using Stacks).
* In this assignment we use stacks from the STL to implement a video game library functionality.
* We create a stack of video games. Add five different game objects to the stack.
* Then using a loop, we display the game information

<h2>sortingAlgorithms</h2>

### General info 

* Implementation of Sorting Algorithms
* In this assignment we are going to implement a couple of sorting algorithms and test their performances.
* We write a program to sort an array using Insertion sort and merge sort.
* For each algorithm, we have a counter to count how many times a comparison is made to sort the array.
* Once this logic is implemented, we create integer arrays of 1000 and 10000 elements with random values inside.
* Then we output the result which shows how many comparisons it made for each algorithm for 1000 and 10000 elements.

<h2>queues</h2>

### General info

* We implement a customer class using queues.
