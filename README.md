<h2>SortingStack</h2>

### General ingo

  * We're using STL stacks to implement an application that sorts a stack.
  * We start filling 20 elements into the stack.
  * Then, using an array, we sort the elements within the stack using merge sort.
  * Lastly, we place the sorted items into the stack again (so the stack becomes sorted) and we print the stack's content.
