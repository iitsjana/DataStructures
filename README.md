<h2>SortingStack</h2>

### General info

  * We're using STL stacks to implement an application that sorts a stack.
  * We start filling 20 elements into the stack.
  * Then, using an array, we sort the elements within the stack using merge sort.
  * Lastly, we place the sorted items into the stack again (so the stack becomes sorted) and we print the stack's content.

<h2>VideoGame</h2>

### General info

* Video Game Implementation (Using Stacks).
* In this assignment we use stacks from the STL to implement a video game library functionality.
* We create a stack of video games. Add five different game objects to the stack.
* Then using a loop, we display the game information
